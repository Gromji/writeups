# MacroHard WeakEdge

In this challenge we are given a **ppt** file. When opened, Microsoft PowerPoint tells us that this file needs to be repaired. After we follow the prompt, we can see that there are 58 slides, two of which contain some text, though not useful to us. Hint there is that, one of the slides that contain the text is hidden. If we run **exiftool** to get some info about the file, we can see that there are 58 slides and 1 hidden slide, that we can not yet see. After failing to grep the text (that was either of the slides) in the binary, it would be logical to thing that this file was encoded somehow. Quick research indicated, that ppt files are really **zip** compressed files. After unzipping the file we are given a **ppt** directory. If we explore this directory we can find a file named **hidden**. This file contains a space separated characters. If we remove those spaces and **base64** decode this text, we are given a flag.
